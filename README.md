# 🔢Computation with NumPy(Numerical Python) of Python

🌟 No Data Science course can be complete without learning NumPy (Numerical Python). NumPy is a Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s practically THE standard for working with numerical data in Python. The case studies for how NumPy is being used speak for themselves 😮

👆 NumPy Interesting Facts👆

🌟 Thinking of Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool that includes functionality for working with time-series or for grouping, joining, merging and finding missing data (i.e., everything we’ve been doing so far). NumPy on the other hand shines with low-level tasks, like doing serious math and calculations.

🌟 Have covered the following problem statements in this notebook:

❓How to leverage the power 💪 of NumPy's ndarrays.

❓How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.

❓How broadcasting 📣 works with ndarrays.

❓How to do linear algebra with NumPy.

❓How to generate points that you can plot on a chart.

❓How to manipulate images as ndarrays.

🌟 The answers to all these are solved in the notebook using methods like:

✅Create arrays manually with np.array()

✅Generate arrays using  .arange(), .random(), and .linspace()

✅Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray

✅Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices

✅Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication

✅Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible

✅Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays

..and many more.

👉 Here's a sample of all these operations performed in the notebook
